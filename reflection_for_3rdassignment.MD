1. Why is it essential to maintain up-to-date and accurate API documentation?
APIs change frequently during development, and outdated documentation can cause confusion and errors. Keeping documentation updated ensures developers and testers understand how the API actually works.

2. What are some best practices you learned for writing effective API documentation?
Effective documentation clearly explains endpoints, parameters, response codes, and authentication. It should be consistent, easy to read, and updated whenever the API changes.

3. How can API documentation improve the developer experience for both internal and external consumers?
Good documentation helps developers quickly understand and test APIs without reading the code. Interactive tools like Swagger UI make integration faster and easier.

4. What are some other tools or frameworks you could explore for API documentation? (e.g., OpenAPI Generator, Redoc)
Other tools include Swagger Editor, SwaggerHub, OpenAPI Generator, and Redoc, which help with editing, collaboration, and generating client code.

5. How would you integrate the generation and deployment of your API documentation into your CI/CD pipeline?
Documentation can be automatically validated or regenerated during CI/CD runs so it always stays in sync with the API before deployment.
